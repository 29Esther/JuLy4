# General Info
Name: **Zhixuan Li**
Nick Name: **Esther**  
Prons: **She/her/hers**

> I named myself **Esther** when I was 15 for my English class. I was looking for a special name, not too complex nor too common. I referred to a website, suggesting English name for girls. There, it wrote: the name originates from Greek with the meaning **star**. Somehow, I chose it without further considerations. Untill recent, I noticed that this name is known from the Jewish queen Esther, eponymous heroine of the Book of Esther.
